# react-p5-cli

## This is a command-line interface tool for creating a scaffold, which aims to integrate react and p5js

The react.js is a framework for UI. And the p5.js is a framework for creative coding. When I need to make an interesting animation in my web based on react, it is difficult for me to use canvas purely. Therefore, I make this CLI to get my scaffold.
