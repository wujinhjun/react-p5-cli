# react-p5-cli

**This is a command-line interface tool for creating a scaffold, which aims to integrate react and p5js**

The react.js is a framework for UI. And the p5.js is a framework for creative coding. When I need to make an interesting animation in my web based on react, it is difficult for me to use canvas purely. Therefore, I make this CLI to get my scaffold.

## Install

If you use the npm:

 ```sh
 npm install react-p5-cli -g
 ```

Or if you use use yarn:

 ```sh
 yarn add react-p5-cli -g
 ```

Or if you use pnpm:

 ```sh
 pnpm install react-p5-cli -g
 ```

## Usage

Create a project
*Default project name is: p5-react*

```sh
rp5 create <project-name>
```

Or

```sh
r-p5 create <project-name>
```
